A custom, private and secure user.js for Firefox.

First run "clean.sh" in a shell like this:
./clean.sh

Then run "make.sh" in a shell like this:
./make.sh

After this, the user.js is installed, it is highly
recommended to run clean once in a while to clear
the cache or the presence of Firefox in the system
for minimalism, privacy or just security purposes.
